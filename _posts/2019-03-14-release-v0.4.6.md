We are pleased to announce version 0.4.6 of the Open Pentesting and Security Framework.

<!-- more -->


This version focused on improving the Web-UI and bug fixing.
We add a simple git bot for disclosed bugs, which will be shortly used
for publishing bugs from our testing instance into a git repository.
The Webinterface is back in an early stage. It includes basic pages and 
only implements bughunting related functions.

There will be no release next week, so the release 0.4.7 will take place in two weeks.


Please report bugs and improvement ideas at our 
[Bug-Tracker](https://codeberg.org/OPAS-F/opas-f-server/issues) or you may want to send
a pull request? ;).
