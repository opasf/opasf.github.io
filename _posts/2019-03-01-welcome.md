Welcome to our new Blog for the "Open Pentesting and Security Framework".

In the last few months we were hardly working on improving the current project state.

<!-- more -->

We successfully moved away from [Gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com), 
which was blocking our workflow with annoying ReCaptchas.
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org) will be our new code hosting platform.


What has changed so far:

- moved server part into new repository
- more customization options for server
- improve (encrypted) report generation
- use zsh to provide a client side terminal
- new plugin system for existing pentesting tools (like nmap & co.)
- python-api repository to support custom clients & bots
- Matrix Bot that posts messages if a bug is disclosed
- easier deployment using docker
- a bit more documentation
- master-slave architecture for distribute your work on multiple clients
- some more minor changes and some rewrites


There are still much more features planned and work in progress.
More information can be found at our repositories at [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/OPAS-F).
